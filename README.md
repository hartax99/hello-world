# hello-world
My name is Ana Hart, and I am a dancer, creator, graphic/UX designer who seeks to use various mediums and platforms to communicate the beauty of shared stories, risk, and human connection on a local and global scale. Currently, I am a junior Dance and Media Arts and Design (SMAD) double major with a concentration in Interactive Design at James Madison University.
